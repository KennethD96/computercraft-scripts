=====================

These are some experiments and samples I have been working on during my time with [Computercraft][cc].

`frameDoor_server.lua` and `frameDoor_client.lua` are part of a door mechanism for password protected incorporating [RedPower 2][rp2] and [Support Frames][rp2_sf].
One computer should be running the frameDoor_server.lua script to control the door mechanism. And the terminals to be accesed to enter password and open the door should be running frameDoor_client.lua.
The server can also be used as a terminal or it could be completely hidden.

Most of these are semi-functional or completely broken.
These are the ones I know to be working:
- frameDoor_server.lua
- frameDoor_client.lua
- disco.lua

The scripts are provided as examples but can also be used as-is.

enjoy.
